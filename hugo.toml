I am PhD Student in mathematics and computer science at Institut
de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse and Artificial and
Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institut.
I'm also a member of the brilliant [<span style="color: blue;">DE</span><span style="color: red;">E</span><span style="color: blue;">L</span> team](https://www.deel.ai) ü§©.
My two amazing supervisors are Nicholas Asher and Laurent Risser.
My interest topics are Fairness, Explainability and Robustness of 
Natural Language Processing algorithms.

Previously I did a master‚Äôs in mathematics and data sciences 
at Ecole Polytechnique, where I co-founded the Artificial 
Intelligence Alumni Association (AlumnIA).
Then I did another master‚Äôs in digital economics and innovation
at Paris-Dauphine University.

I'm committed to the fight against
gender inequality in STEM ü§ñ (see: <span style="color: blue;">[ANITI's gender equality commission](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/en/mixite/)</span> and <span style="color: blue;">[women and mathematics association](https://femmes-et-maths.fr)</span>). In my spare time,
I practice crossfit and weightlifting.
I also danced ballet for over 17 years before that. 

If you would like to contact me, you can find my CV and contact details here ‚¨áÔ∏è.
