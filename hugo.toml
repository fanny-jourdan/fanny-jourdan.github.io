I'm a researcher in the [DEEL](https://www.deel.ai) team at the Technological Research Institut ([IRT](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com)) Saint Exupery in Toulouse. 
üîç My research topics are explainability (XAI), robustness and logic in Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms.

I have a PhD in mathematics and computer science from the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT) and the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse 
Institute (ANITI) under the supervision of Nicholas Asher and Laurent Risser.

Before that, I did a master's degree in mathematics and data science at the √âcole polytechnique, where I co-founded the Artificial Intelligence Alumni Association (AlumnIA). 
Then I did another master's in digital economics and innovation at Paris-Dauphine University.


I'm committed to the fight against
gender inequality in STEM ü§ñ (see: ANITI's [diversity commission](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/en/mixite/) and [women and mathematics](https://femmes-et-maths.fr) association). In my spare time,
I practice crossfit and weightlifting. 
I also danced ballet for over 17 years before that. 

If you would like to contact me, you can find my CV and contact details here ‚¨áÔ∏è.
